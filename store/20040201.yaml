  h1: Buying an engine
  p_1: "I bought a 289 small block ford V8 from a GT40 enthusiasts club member. I had been for a spin in his car before he
    took the engine out and stripped it for a rebuild.
    When the block went to the shop for machining and the deck of the block was skimmed a hairline crack was found
    between the water jacket and two of the cylinders.
    At Â£65 for a complete engine i figured it was worth the risk that it might leak water into the cylinder."
